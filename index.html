    <!-- Seraph Station The Seraph Station project challenged us to design a unique
    station that would transport people through time. The result is a fresh and
    futuristic model inspired by space stations. See Our Portfolio Federal II
    Tower A sequel theme project for a tower originally built in the 1800s. We
    achieved this with a striking look of brutal minimalism with modern touches.
    See Our Portfolio Trinity Bank Tower Trinity Bank challenged us to make a
    concept for a 84 story building located in the middle of a city with a high
    earthquake frequency. For this project we used curves to blend design and
    stability to meet our objectives. See Our Portfolio 01 02 03 04  -->
